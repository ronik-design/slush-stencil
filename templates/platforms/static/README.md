## Directory structure

* `assets` place files and directories to be directly copied to the output /
  static directory.

* `sprites` place `svg` files you would like automatically compiled into a svg icon
  stack.

* `images` static images (backgrounds, etc) that you want optimized.

* `scripts` client-side JS, to be compiled with Webpack. Code style dictates
  use of ES6 (all files are transpiled using babel) and the `jsx` extension
  when appropriate.

* `styles` all site styles, written in Stylus. `nib`, and `rupture` available,
  along with your chosen framework (Basic, Bootstrap, Skeleton)

* `data` json files that can store page data for swig templates

* `pages` where your page templates live. These get converted into site pages. Uses swig.

* `templates` supporting template files

* `tasks` are all the gulp tasks for the project. caveat lector
