## Local Modules

Place modules here you would like to make available to `require` and `import`
statements, just like `node_modules`.

Useful if you're developing custom modules that you might want to break
into separate projects / repos in the future, or simply for organization.

That said, it's probably not a great idea to place anything in here that isn't
self-contained, or has highly app-specific logic.
