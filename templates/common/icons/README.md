## Icons

Any `svg` files placed in here will automatically be incorporated into the
iconfont, and made available via icon-[filename] classes.

For example:

* Place `open.svg` in folder.
* File is renamed `uE002-open.svg`
* Iconfont codepoint is accessible in a class like this:

```html
<span class="icon icon-open"></span>
```
